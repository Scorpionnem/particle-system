This project is still a WIP as I didnt evaluate it yet

A simple particle system built using OpenGL and its compute shaders
This project is part of the 42 curriculum, aiming to explore parallel computing to work on optimized programs.

The main goals of the project are:
- Handling millions of particles smoothly (Subjects asks for 1 million particles at 60fps and I get ~270fps)

To compile and run this project you can just use make/make bonus to create the binary file used to launch the program.

And here are a few screenshots to showcase the project:

To be added.
