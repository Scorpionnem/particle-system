A simple particle system built using OpenGL and its compute shaders
This project is part of the 42 curriculum, aiming to explore parallel computing to work on optimized programs.

The main goals of the project are:
- Handling millions of particles smoothly (Subjects asks for 1 million particles at 60fps and I get ~270fps)
- Clean synchronisation of memory between CPU and GPU

To compile and run this project you can just use make/make bonus to create the binary file used to launch the program.

And here are a few screenshots to showcase the project:
