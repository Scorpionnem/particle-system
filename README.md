42 Grade: 125/100

A simple particle system built using OpenGL and its compute shaders
This project is part of the 42 curriculum, aiming to explore parallel computing to work on optimized programs.

The main goals of the project are:
- Handling millions of particles smoothly (Subjects asks for 1 million particles at 60fps and I get ~270fps)
- Clean synchronisation of memory between CPU and GPU

For the bonuses I didnt go too crazy:
- Camera/Emitters as the subject asks
- Color can be set as the velocity of the particle
- Different color modes
- Particles fade out and get smaller as they die (Only affects particles from emitters)
- Change the shape/size of the main particles

To compile and run this project you can just use make/make bonus to create the binary file used to launch the program.

And here are a few screenshots to showcase the project:
